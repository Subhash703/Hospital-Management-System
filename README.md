# Hospital-Management-System
This is my Java project of Hospital Management System

***************** HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM **************************

Concept I have used for the project :
Inheritance (extendeding Hospital class )
Strings (String and StringBuilder class)
DateTime API (For saving the date of patient’s adimitting in hospital)
Polymorphism 
File Handling
Abstract classes (Made Main class as an abstract class 
Interfaces (A interface called HospitalInfo, which is implemented by Hospital class,Pdata is an Interface having patient details)
User Exception handling (Handling execption while accessing the private information in Main class). (If password is not correct than it will throw an Userdefined execption). : The password is “scdev”.
IO fundamentals (Reading data from user and saving it into CSV files).
